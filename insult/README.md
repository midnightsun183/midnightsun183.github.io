Insult Generator Shortcode
==========================

### Generates insults for you in four flavors:

Here are a few example combinations for each of the four insult types:

* Baroque

  * dissembling dread-bolted strumpet
  * mammering fool-born fustilarian
  * mangled flap-mouthed coxcomb
  * gleeking swag-bellied apple-john
  * cockered tickle-brained giglet
  * mewling bat-fowling death-token
  * warped spur-galled gudgeon

* Modern

  * smarmy contrarian dick
  * stinky toilet-breathed ass-captain
  * cheese-toothed common pig

* Hook _( as in, the movie 'Hook' )_

  * pimple-farmin' lying, crying, spying, prying finger bandage
  * boil-dripping scab-picked bubble-butt
  * fart-sniffing camel-cake week old maggot burger with everything on it and flies on the side
  * two-toned cheesy lewd, crude, rude, bag of pre-chewed food dude

* Python _(Legendary British comedy super-group, not the language)_
  * empty-headed hypocritical hamster
  * vacuous whining chemist
  * loathsome coffee-nosed pervert
  * silly hypocritical Freemason

### Usage:

* Install and activate

* Place the [insult] shortcode anywhere you'd like an insult to appear

* You can use the following shortcode attributes:

* dirty: `[insult dirty="yes"]` or `[insult dirty="no"]`. If yes, it will prepend the word "fucking" to the insult.

*  type: `[insult type="baroque"]` or `[insult type="hook"]` or `[insult type="modern"]` or `[insult type="python"]`. This will use different arrays of insult combinations, depending on the one you select. Defaults to baroque insults, naturally.
